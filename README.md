This is used to reduce the crime rate locally and globally by implementing the idea in two phases.

Phase 1:
Using the blockchain technology while filing an FIR so that once an FIR is filed,it cannot be manipulated.
Hence,the bribing for change of FIR can be controlled.

Phase 2:
As we know many crimes are done using fake passports.So if blockchain technology is used with passports,fake passports can be controlled.

Thus,by implementing these two phases,crimes can be controlled.
